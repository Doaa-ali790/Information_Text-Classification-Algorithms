# Text Classification Algorithms in Natural Language Processing (NLP)

## Overview
Text Classification is one of the fundamental tasks in Natural Language Processing (NLP).
It focuses on assigning predefined categories or labels to textual data automatically.
This repository is based on a scientific paper that discusses **Text Classification Algorithms**
and their applications in NLP.

Text classification plays a critical role in many real-world applications such as spam detection,
sentiment analysis, topic categorization, intent recognition, and document filtering.

## Problem Statement
With the rapid growth of digital text data, manual classification has become impractical.
Text classification algorithms aim to automatically analyze and categorize text accurately
and efficiently using computational methods.

## Main Text Classification Approaches

### 1. Traditional Machine Learning Algorithms
These methods rely on manual feature extraction techniques such as Bag of Words (BoW) and TF-IDF.

Common algorithms include:
- Naive Bayes
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Decision Trees
- k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)

**Advantages:**
- Simple and fast
- Require less computational power

**Disadvantages:**
- Limited understanding of semantic context
- Performance depends heavily on feature engineering

---

### 2. Deep Learning-Based Algorithms
Deep learning models automatically learn features from data using neural networks.

Examples:
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)

**Advantages:**
- Better performance on large datasets
- Can capture contextual information

**Disadvantages:**
- Require large datasets
- Computationally expensive

---

### 3. Transformer-Based Models
Modern NLP systems use transformer architectures for text classification.

Examples:
- BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)
- RoBERTa
- GPT-based models

**Advantages:**
- State-of-the-art performance
- Strong contextual understanding
- Bidirectional language modeling

**Disadvantages:**
- High computational cost
- Require powerful hardware for training

## Text Representation Techniques
Text must be converted into numerical form before classification.

Common techniques include:
- Bag of Words (BoW)
- TF-IDF
- Word Embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe)
- Contextual Embeddings (BERT embeddings)

---

## Applications of Text Classification
- Spam Detection
- Sentiment Analysis
- Topic Classification
- Intent Detection
- News Categorization
- Email Filtering

---

## Conclusion
The paper highlights that no single algorithm is optimal for all text classification tasks.
Traditional machine learning methods are efficient for small datasets,
while deep learning and transformer-based models achieve higher accuracy
on complex and large-scale NLP problems.

The choice of algorithm depends on:
- Dataset size
- Computational resources
- Required accuracy
- Application domain
